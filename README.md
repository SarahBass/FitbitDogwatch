## DESCRIPTION: 

This game will teach you the basics of morse code with cute animations. Morse code is a great life skill to have, as it is used to communicate using light or sound. It especially comes in handy as a distress signal. Most people know the famous S.O.S morse code, but now you can learn all the letters of the alphabet! Morse code is still used today in the Military/Navy, Science Department, Ham Radio Community, Girl/Boy Scouts, and much more.  

## How to play: 
When you get the morse correctly, an animation plays. When it is incorrect, you will see a large X appear. This addicting little game plays
two rounds. Refresh by swiping back to your watch mainscreen, and click again to play. Every time you play, a new letter is generated.
 No time commitment at all, the game take less than 30 seconds.
