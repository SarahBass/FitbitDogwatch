## DESCRIPTION: 

This game will teach you the basics of morse code with cute animations. Morse code is a great life skill to have, as it is used to communicate using light or sound. It especially comes in handy as a distress signal. Most people know the famous S.O.S morse code, but now you can learn all the letters of the alphabet! Morse code is still used today in the Military/Navy, Science Department, Ham Radio Community, Girl/Boy Scouts, and much more.  

## How to play: 
When you get the morse correctly, an animation plays. When it is incorrect, you will see a large X appear. This addicting little game plays
two rounds. Refresh by swiping back to your watch mainscreen, and click again to play. Every time you play, a new letter is generated.
 No time commitment at all, the game take less than 30 seconds.

This game includes 2 animations per letter and 3 animations per mode with a total of 14 frames, 2 icons, 55 objects, 2 buttons, and 1 background. These already existed from my other project ABC Pup for Android, and were repurposed and resized from svgs into small 336x336 and 300x300 pngs or jpegs.

The space creature: Is it a cat? Is it a dog? It's a pomeranian! See the cute dog that inspired this app : https://www.instagram.com/koonchki/. 

The space creature is actually part of the logo for my studio name for Android, called 'Koonchki Studios'. Yes, it is only a one girl & one dog studio- with no pay! Please be respectful, and do not copy my logo dog as it is used for Android app and many other projects that I do. Github is to share code, not share art. On a lighter note, what does "Koonchki" mean? Koonchki is the name my grandmother used to call all her grandchildren. She passed away many years ago, but her silliness still lives on in all our hearts <3

All artwork was made in Vectornator, a free art application on ipad: https://www.vectornator.io/. 
Many of the objects come from Iconator with a few alterations. This is a free feature of Vectornator.
