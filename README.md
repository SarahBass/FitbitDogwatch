Learn and have fun with a little virtual space pet at the touch of your finger tips!

DESCRIPTION: 

This game will teach you the basics of morse code with cute animations. Control your virtual pet by feeding him or changing the background, all with the use of swipe motions to simulate morse. Morse code is a great life skill to have, as it is used to communicate using light or sound. It especially comes in handy as a distress signal. Most people know the famous S.O.S morse code, but now you can learn all the letters of the alphabet! Morse code is still used today in the Military/Navy, Science Department, Ham Radio Community, Girl/Boy Scouts, and much more.  

How to play: 
MODES:
Game:When you get the morse correctly, an animation plays. When it is incorrect, you will see a large X appear. 
Pet: Feed your space pet to make it happy.  
Explore: Go to different worlds! 

Settings: Turning vibrations off may be more comfortable to users. Go to your settings and turn off Vibrations or turn to low.
