## DESCRIPTION: 

This game will teach you the basics of morse code with cute animations. Morse code is a great life skill to have, as it is used to communicate using light or sound. It especially comes in handy as a distress signal. Most people know the famous S.O.S morse code, but now you can learn all the letters of the alphabet! Morse code is still used today in the Military/Navy, Science Department, Ham Radio Community, Girl/Boy Scouts, and much more.  

## How to play: 
When you get the morse correctly, an animation plays. When it is incorrect, you will see a large X appear. This addicting little game only plays
two rounds and keeps no score. Refresh by swiping back to your watch mainscreen, and click again to play. Everytime you play, a new letter is generated.
Already know that letter by heart? Swipe out of the game and back in for a new letter! No time commitment at all, the game take less than 30 seconds to 
play everytime.

This game includes 2 animations per letter and 3 animations per mode with a total of 14 frames, 2 icons, 55 objects, 2 buttons, and 1 background. These already existed from my other project ABC Pup for Android, and were repurposed and resized from svgs into small 336x336 and 300x300 pngs or jpegs.

The space creature: Is it a cat? Is it a dog? It's a pomeranian! See the cute dog that inspired this app : https://www.instagram.com/koonchki/. 
This is actually the logo for my "studio" name , Koonchki Studios. A one girl and one dog studio!  Please be respectful, and do not copy my logo dog 
as it is used for Android app and many other projects that I do. What does "Koonchki" mean? Koonchki is the name my grandmother used to call her grandchildren. She passed away many years ago, but her silliness still lives on in all our hearts <3

All artwork was made in Vectornator, a free art application on ipad. I highly reccomend this program for programming, it is much easier to use than adobe, has tons of resources, and is free! https://www.vectornator.io/. I really love this application, and I can't reccomend enough. I've used AI and honestly this is less  headache by far, although if you are making svg animations, adobe works more smoothly with game design platforms. Many of the objects come from Iconator, a free feature of Vectornator.
